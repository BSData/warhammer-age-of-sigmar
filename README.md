**The Battlescribe data editor can cause problems when merging updates. Because of this, and also to avoid duplicated 
effort where multiple people are working on the same files, please join us on Gitter before you commit changes to the files.**

**UPDATE AoS 3.0:**
The Catalogs have been updated to support Matched Play points and FAQ's for AoS v3.0 release. 
The **\***Pitched Battle***\** Profile supports matched play and includes the new Core Battalions.
The new **\***Narrative Battle***\** Profile supports play with warscroll Battalions.  This is where you'll find all the previous
edition Battalion warscrolls.

The changes for AoS 3.0 are significant and undoubtedly some things are broken, missing or just plain wrong.  Please file a bug
for errors, omissions per the bug reporting documented below.

* __What's this?__

  _BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by the community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]_ and when you're done there take a look at the [WAoS Catalog Wiki - Implementation Guidelines][]

* __Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._
 
  _Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]_

## Reporting bugs & contact us ##

* __I found a bug!__
 
  _Great, thank you! Now you have two options:_

  1. [Report it on Appspot][] - it's anonymous and no account is needed - one downside, you will need to manually check the progress of your issue.
  2. [Open Issue directly][] (green ```New Issue``` in upper-right) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!

* __I'd just like to contact you.__

  Then join us on Discord!

  [![Chat on Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/558412685981777922?style=popout-square)](https://www.bsdata.net/contact)

  _Otherwise, the easiest way is through issues mentioned above. We are a community and that's the only place we all have access to. We don't have any group e-mail. So if you want to stay anonymous, contact us by reporting bug on Appspot (point 1 above)._
